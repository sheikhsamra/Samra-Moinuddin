            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>
                Every journey begins with a spark. Mine started with a simple curiosity: 
                <q>“How are websites made?”</q> What began as interest slowly grew into passion, and eventually into a mission.  
            </p>

            <h2>Hi, I’m Sheikh Samra Moinuddin</h2>

            <p>
                I am a Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer, Graphic Designer, and an explorer of cutting-edge technologies. 
                I still remember the first time I wrote a simple HTML tag and saw a tiny piece of text appear on the screen. 
                That moment taught me something powerful: technology is magic — and I wanted to master that magic.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a naturally creative person, design has never been just about colors or shapes — 
                it’s about emotion, storytelling, and identity. When I combined design with coding, I realized:  
                <q>My strength isn’t just writing code — it's creating meaningful digital experiences.</q>
            </p>

            <p>
                Over time, I gained strong command over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Firebase, Python, and AI tools — 
                especially Agentic AI, which I am actively exploring. Each project challenged me, shaped me, and helped me grow into a more confident professional.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, I don’t just build websites — I craft digital experiences. Experiences that are fast, visually appealing, intuitive, and human-centered.  
                Whether it’s an e-commerce platform, a portfolio, a modern UI, an AI-powered application, or a custom interactive interface — my goal is always the same: 
                <strong>“Perfection. Performance. Personality.”</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I value every pixel, every animation, every spacing, and every interaction — because every detail is part of the story I create.  
                With multiple successful projects under my belt, my love for technology continues to grow. Each new project is an opportunity to build something unique.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are looking for someone who can think creatively, design beautifully, develop intelligently, and deliver professionally — I would love to bring your ideas to life.  
                Because for me: <q>“It’s not just about building a website. It’s about creating an experience people remember.”</q>
            </p>
